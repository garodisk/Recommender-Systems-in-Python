# Recommender-Systems-in-Python

Implemented recommender systems on a Kaggle's MovieLens 100k dataset in Python

Recommender Systems is one of the areas which ignited my interest in Data Science. Being an avid end-user of Netflix, Amazon and a couple more eCommerce and content-based platforms, I was fascinated by the quality of recommendation I used to get which made my life easier.Â 

# What are Recommender Systems?

Wikipedia says 'A recommender system or a recommendation system (sometimes replacing 'system' with a synonym such as a platform or an engine) is a subclass of information filtering system that seeks to predict the "rating" or "preference" a user would give to an item. They are primarily used in commercial applications.

I have implemented 3 types of recommender systems -

1) Content-Based Recommender Systems
2) Metadata-based Recommender Systems
3) Collaborative filtering based Recommender Systems

All the three notebooks contain stepwise explaanation with a introduction to all types of recommendation systems.

Here's the blogs I have written based on these projects :-
